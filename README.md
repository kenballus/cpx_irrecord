Record and play back IR signals with an Adafruit CPX

To record a signal, point your IR transmitter in front of the CPX and send the signal. Then, press the left button (D4) on the CPX. Repeat this process as many times as you like. When you flip the switch (D7), the signals will play back in the order you recorded them, on a loop. Flip the switch back to stop it. To reset, press the right button (D5).
